To send files, use Sender:
    Sender <protocol selector> <timeout> <filename>

    Example: $ Sender 0 500 ~/Downloads/nsfw_vid.avi

  Arguments:
    protocol selector:
        * 0 for Go-Back-N
        * 1 for Selective Repeat

    timeout:
        positive integer representing timeout in milliseconds

    filename:
        path to file to be sent

To receive files, use Receiver:
    Receiver <protocol selector> <filename>

    Example: $ Receiver 0 ~/Videos/friends_nsfw_vid.avi

  Arguments:
    protocol selector:
        * 0 for Go-Back-N
        * 1 for Selective Repeat

    filename:
        path to save the received file


To build the project:
    make clean
    make


Notes:
- GoBackN works, but seems to have problems with keeping EOF/EOL (text is manageable, binaries are wack)
- SelectiveRepeat does not fully work. Seems to freeze on EOT
